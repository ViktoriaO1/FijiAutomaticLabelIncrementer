# FijiAutomaticLabelIncrementer
The purpose of this script is to enable multi-object keypoint labeling for an imagestack in ImageJ. With each click the counter/label of the point is automatically incremented in order to be able to distinguish a set of chosen labels more easily also already when labeling in ImageJ.

Open the labeling_no_delete.py script in a script editor in ImageJ, open your images and hit 'Run' to start labeling.
